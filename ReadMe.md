# Room_Co2_model
#### The models run in a Linux environment.
1. Draw a picture of a room.（Black for impermeable structure, red for people, yellow for ventilation ducts, blue for ventilation systems, gray for windows.）Then save it as house.bmp
2. Run the photo.py. It will creat a roomco2.log file base on the house.bmp as the input of the model.
3. Run run_co2.sh in the terminal.
4. Finally the model will creat a roomco2.log file as the input of [CD++ Web Viewer](https://staubibr.github.io/arslab-prd/app-simple/index.html "CD++ Web Viewer")
